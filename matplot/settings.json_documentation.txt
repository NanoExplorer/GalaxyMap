When step_type is linear, the correlation values do basically what you would expect.
each point is 'step_size' away from the last, starting at 'min_r'. The range for the bins goes from 
'r_value - dr' to 'r_value + dr'.

However, when using the logarithmic step type, everything changes meaning. Now, each point is 
(10^(step_size*n))*(10^(step_size)-1) away from the next point, and 
10^(step_size*n)*(1-10^(-step_size)) away from the last point.
dr becomes the percentage of the distance between the point in question and each neighboring point to use in the bin.
If dr is 1, then the n=2 point would have a bin from the n=1 point to the n=3 point. dr=0.5 would result in 
the n=2 point's bin stretching from halfway between n=1 and n=2 to halfway between n=2 and n=3.
