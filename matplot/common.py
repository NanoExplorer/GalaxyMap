This file contains common functions used by my millenium programs. It contains mostly housekeeping functions
like loading files and outputting data.

Function reference:
    getdict(filename)
        Gets json settings stored in the filename, parses them and returns them as a python dictionary
    gensettings(args)
        takes an args paramater from argparse (assumed to have a  and writes a sample settings json file
        to settings.json in the current folder.
    loadCSVData(filename)
        Loads galaxy coordinates from a CSV file.
        Returns (xs, ys, zs) as a tuple
    makeplot(xs,ys,title,xl,yl)
        makes a matplotlib plot with the given X values, Y values, title, x label and y label.
    writecsv(xslist,yslist)
        VERY ESOTERIC USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION.
        Kept for legacy reasons.
        Writes a csv file with alternating X and Y columns, where x is a list of lists of x coordinates
        and yslist is a list of lists of y coordinates.
