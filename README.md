This is a project for doing statistical analysis on galaxy positions. 

To run any python script in the Mayavi folder, you need to use python 2 and have Mayavi installed. Installing Mayavi is outside the scope of this readme.

To run any python script in the Matplot folder, you need to use python 3 and have matplotlib installed. Again, installing matplotlib is outside the scope of this readme.

So far, the matplot scripts can create a hammer projection of angular distribution of galaxies and histograms of galaxy x, y, and z positions. The mayavi scripts can plot all galaxies in 3d and plot galaxy density isosurfaces.
